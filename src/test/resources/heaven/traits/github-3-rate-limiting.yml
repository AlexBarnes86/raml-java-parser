name: Rate Limited
description: |
  We limit requests to 60 per hour for unauthenticated requests. For requests 
  using Basic Authentication or OAuth, we limit requests to 5,000 per hour.
  
  # Unauthenticated rate limited requests
  
  If you need to make unauthenticated calls but need to use a higher rate 
  limit associated with your OAuth application, you can send over your client
   ID and secret in the query string.
   
  # Staying within the rate limit
  
  If you are using Basic Authentication or OAuth, and you are exceeding your 
  rate limit, you can likely fix the issue by caching API responses and using 
  conditional requests.

  If youâ€™re using conditional requests and still exceeding your rate limit, 
  please [contact us](https://github.com/contact) to request a higher rate 
  limit for your OAuth application.
